Coding flowchart

> Finding necessary libraries including face recognition
> Upload employees face images in different angles(front, right side, left side)
         include corresponding employee name and ID
> check clarity of images
> multiple employees at a time
> face style detection
> cooling glass detect
> cap
> mask
> male female classification
> face movement
> EDA
> Split datas into train and test data
> Accuracy checking using algorithms
