## ATTENDANCE MANGEMENT SYSTEM USING CAM
 The Attendance Management System using Web Cam is a modern solution that automates the process of recording and managing attendance by leveraging facial recognition technology through a webcam
 - Facial Recognition Technology:
    - The system uses a webcam to capture live images or video streams of individuals.
- Real time attendence loging:

    - Every individual’s face is linked to their profile in the system’s database.
    - When the face is recognized by the webcam, the system automatically records attendance along with a timestamp.
- Report generation
    - The system generates reports showing attendance on selected date.
    - Administrators can monitor patterns, identify absentees

Conclusion:

The Attendance Management System using Web Cam provides an efficient and automated way to manage attendance, improving productivity and accuracy in organizations. By leveraging facial recognition technology, it offers a modern and user-friendly solution that can easily be implemented in various domains like schools, offices, and events.

## Algorithm used

- deep learning using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

    -  A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly effective for tasks involving image and video data. CNNs are widely used in computer vision applications, such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition, as well as in other fields like medical imaging and natural language processing.
